When I ssh into the stage and production, and look at the config/database.yml files in both environments, the production yml file contains a password and stage does not. Both files have a comment at the top that the file is maintained in puppet but I'm not sure where in puppet this file is being generated. Do you know where I should look for this value? Thanks!*"
